# Treehouse-Techdegree-Unit-5
 The last Techdegree Project

This project consists in a Portfolio of the previous Treehouse Techdegree projects. 
It was developped with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

To run locally this project, you'll need to install flask and SQLALchemy (pip install suggested).

I learned to integrate most of the knowledge of Python programming (python classes, 
flask, SQLALchemy, datetime objects, database connecting,  just to mention some).
